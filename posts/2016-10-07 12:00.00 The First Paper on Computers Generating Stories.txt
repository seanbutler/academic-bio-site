<h3>klein's,original paper, possibly the first real story generator.</h2>
<h5>7th october 2016</h5>

<h4>klein, s. et al (1973) automatic novel writing. university of wisconsin technical report.</h4>
<p>sheldon klein and others wrote the original paper on computers automatically generating narratives. their approach set the tone for narrative generation for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>a semantic deep structure of the universe was encoded in the form of what we would now call a semantic network. nodes being semantic objects and arcs being the relationships between them.</p>
<p>the simulation also contains rules which can alter the the universe. these are used to represent events in the story. the rules themselves were also semantic networks.</p>
<p>klein states the presuppositional information of the rules is coded within them, which we take to mean the pre-requisites. that which has to occur for the rules to be applied.</p>
<p>the final narrative it built from the sequence of changes to the modelled stat of the mini-universe.</p>

<h4>implementation details</h4>
<p>the network itself was stored as triples, every atom of which had a unique id, as did each triple. in this way any triple could link to any atom or another triple by referencing its id.<p>
<p>the triples themselves could be listed together in sublists or separately and indexed via their id.</p>

<pre>
1. O(man) -> R(break)->O(window)
          R(break)->R(with)->O(hammer)
2. O(man) -> R(in) ->O(park)
</pre>

<p>which means, "the man in the park broke the window with the hammer"</p>
<p>with the benefit of time passing and hindsight we can of course see this isnt a million miles from Sowa's conceptual structures.</p>

    <h2>klein, s. et al (1973) automatic novel writing. university of wisconsin technical report.</h2>
    <h6>7th october 2016</h6>

    <p>sheldon klein and others wrote the original paper on computers automatically generating narratives. their approach set the tone for narrative generation for the next 20 years.</p>

    <p>a semantic deep structure of the universe was encoded in the form of what we would now call a semantic network. nodes being semantic objects and arcs being the relationships between them.
    </p>

    <p>the simulation also contains rules which can alter the the universe. these are used to represent events in the story. the rules themselves were also semantic networks.
    </p>

    <p>klein states the presuppositional information of the rules is coded within them, which we take to mean the pre-requisites. that which has to occur for the rules to be applied.
    </p>

    <p>the final narrative it built from the sequence of changes to the modelled stat of the mini-universe.
    </p>

    <h5>implementation details</h5>

    <p>the network itself was stored as triples, every atom of which had a unique id, as did each triple. in this way any triple could link to any atom or another triple by referencing its id.<p>

<p>the triples themselves could be listed together in sublists or separately and indexed via their id.</p>

<pre>
1. O(man) -> R(break)->O(window)
          R(break)->R(with)->O(hammer)
2. O(man) -> R(in) ->O(park)
</pre>

<p>which means, "the man in the park broke the window with the hammer"</p>
<p>with the benefit of time passing and hindsight we can of course see this isnt a million miles from Sowa's conceptual structures.</p>

<!--<h6>notes...</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>modeled a mini-universe to simulate the story.</li>
        <li>characters and events were governed by rules within the system.</li>
        <li>used a semantic network to store the current state of the universe, the situation. also semantic network to encode the rules by which changes to the universe could happen, the events.</li>
        <li>translation into english was carried out by a separate system of production rules.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>klein's,original paper, possibly the first real story generator.</h2>
<h5>7th october 2016</h5>
<h4>klein, s. et al (1973) automatic novel writing. university of wisconsin technical report.</h4>

<p>sheldon klein and others wrote the original paper on computers automatically generating narratives. their approach set the tone for narrative generation for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>they created a network of nodes and arcs in what we would now call a semantic network. nodes representing the concepts and the arcs being the relationships between them.</p>
<p>in this way they mainteined a graph database of the current status of the story universe as it were.</p>
<p>the simulation also contains rules which can alter the the universe. these are used to represent events in the story. the rules themselves were also semantic networks. klein states the presuppositional information of the rules is coded within them, which we take to mean; the rules contain their own pre requisites <i>and</i> the transformation to be applied on the larger semantic network which occurs as the rules are applied.</p>
<p>the final narrative it built from the sequence of changes to the modelled state of the mini-universe. the intial and final states of the universe are represented by the contents of the database and the sequence of rules applied represent the events of the story</p>

<h4>implementation details</h4>
<p>the network itself was stored as triples, every atom of which had a unique id, as did each triple. in this way any triple could link to any atom or another triple by referencing its id.<p>
<p>the triples themselves could be listed together in sublists or separately and indexed via their id.</p>

<pre>
1. O(man) -> R(break)->O(window)
          R(break)->R(with)->O(hammer)
2. O(man) -> R(in) ->O(park)
</pre>

<p>which means, "the man in the park broke the window with the hammer"</p>
<p>with the benefit of time passing and hindsight we can of course see this isnt a million miles from Sowa's conceptual structures.</p>
